    <h2>Artist’s&nbsp;Statement</h2>
    <p>
      “My work is primarily driven by the idea of the creation of a unified whole through the use of
      minute details. The use of pop colors, lines and circles that swirl & undulate result in
      playful artwork made with passion. I use ink and other mediums to create flowing, intricate
      and highly detailed patterns, sometimes utilizing words for positive inspiration. Self healing
      and positive energy are the motivating concepts which ignite my passion to create. Through my
      work I hope to inspire and help others follow their dreams. I try to bring a fantastical,
      dreamlike appearance to my artwork, which includes digital drawings, mixed media and pen & ink
      illustrations.”
